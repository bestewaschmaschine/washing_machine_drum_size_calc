This calculator helps you calculate the drum size of the washing machine. 

Here is the simple calculator to calculate the right size of the washing machine for your house by taking into account the weight of dry laundry


It is not that easy to calculate the correct drum size of the washing machine which suits you the best. There are so many things which need to be taken into account like how many clothes you used per month and how many times you want to use the washing machine. Because if you use a washing machine which is too small for your household then you will use it more and which eventually means higher electricity and water usage. If you buy a washing machine too big capactiy then you might run it half-load which will eventually damage your washing machine. It is not recommended to use a washing machine on half-load unless it has the load management feature. That’s why we have made this calculator which will help you find the suitable washing machine for you.


* This calculator is just to give you an idea, which washing machine capacity suits you the best but we would like to point out that we have used the average weight of clothes. The actual weight of your clothes could vary. If you buy a washing machine based on this calculator then we are not liable for any loss or damage. 

How we calculated the capacity of the washing machine. 

Suppose, most T-Shirts have an average weight of 200 gram and if you want to know how many Tshirts your washing machine can wash at a time then just divide your washing machine capacity by T-Shirts. It will give an answer.

For example:
6 kg Washing machine / 0.2 kg T-Shirt = 30 T-Shirts. This way you can calculate how much clothes you can wash per cycle in the “X” kg washing machine. 

In the above calculator, we have taken some of the most used clothes in any household. Each cloth has a different weight and we have taken an average weight of these clothes. Then ask you about your weekly laundry. This way we have calculated the total weight of your weekly and monthly laundry. 

This way, we know how many clothes you used per month and what would be the weight of it. After that, we ask you to tell us how many times you want to use the washing machine per month. This way, we can calculate which washing machine size is suitable for you.

For Example:

-	30 kg clothes per month / 4 washes per month = 7.5 kg ~ 8 kg 
We round off to the nearest value of available washing machines. 

For this calculator, the minimum size of the washing machine is 6 kg and the maximum size of the washing machine is 12 kg. We have written a detailed article where we have mentioned everything you need to know about the different sizes of the washing machine.
